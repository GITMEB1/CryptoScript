# Test Coverage Analysis for Crypto Trading Bot

## Current Test Implementation

We have implemented comprehensive test coverage for:

1. **Position Management**
   - Basic position initialization and fee handling
   - Minimum order size validation
   - Decimal precision in calculations
   - PnL calculations (realized/unrealized)

2. **Risk Management**
   - ATR-based position sizing
   - Daily loss limit enforcement
   - Dynamic position sizing based on volatility
   - Stop level calculations

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Portfolio risk management
   - Complete trade lifecycle
   - Multiple position handling

## Areas for Further Testing

1. **Edge Cases**
   - Market gaps and extreme volatility
   - Network errors and retry logic
   - API rate limiting
   - Insufficient balance scenarios

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Memory usage during long runs
   - CPU utilization with multiple positions
   - Database/storage efficiency
   - Backtesting speed optimization

3. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid API responses
   - Connection timeouts
   - Data validation failures
   - Recovery procedures

## Questions for Analysis

1. **Test Data Generation**
   - How should we generate realistic market scenarios?
   - What parameters need to be configurable?
   - How do we ensure reproducibility?

2. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - What metrics should we track?
   - What are acceptable thresholds?
   - How do we measure improvement?

3. **Integration Testing**
   - What additional scenarios need coverage?
   - How do we test external dependencies?
   - What mocking strategies should we use?

## Example Test Cases to Implement

```python
def test_market_gap_handling(self):
    """Test handling of market gaps in price data"""
    pass

def test_api_rate_limiting(self):
    """Test behavior under API rate limits"""
    pass

def test_insufficient_balance(self):
    """Test handling of insufficient balance scenarios"""
    pass

def test_performance_metrics(self):
    """Test performance under load"""
    pass
```

## Success Criteria
